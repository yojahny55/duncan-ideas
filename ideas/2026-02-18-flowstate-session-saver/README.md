# FlowState — Work Session Saver 🧠

**One-liner:** Capture your entire work context when switching tasks — restore exactly where you were with one click.

## Problem Statement

Context switching is devastating for productivity. When you're deep in a task and get interrupted (meeting, urgent Slack, different project), you lose:

1. **Mental context** — What were you thinking? What was your next step?
2. **Digital context** — Which tabs, files, and apps were open?
3. **Momentum** — The 23+ minutes it takes to get back into flow state

Current solutions (browser tab managers, workspace apps) save the *what* but miss the *why* — the mental notes about where you were and what you were doing.

## The Pain (Research)

- **Forbes 2026:** "Coordination, not execution, has become the dominant source of friction" in modern work
- **Cal Newport research:** Context switches cost an average of 23 minutes to recover
- **Developer surveys:** 47% of developers' workdays are lost to interruptions and context switching
- **Remote work reality:** Workers switch contexts 400+ times per day between apps

## Target Users

- **Knowledge workers** juggling multiple projects
- **Developers** interrupted mid-code
- **Researchers** with complex, ongoing investigations
- **Students** balancing multiple courses/papers
- **Anyone who thinks** "Where was I?" multiple times per day

## Proposed Solution

**FlowState** is a work session preservation system that:

1. **Captures context instantly** — One hotkey when interrupted
2. **Records mental state** — Voice note or quick text about what you were doing
3. **Snapshots digital state** — Open tabs, files, apps, clipboard
4. **Restores everything** — One click to reopen exactly where you were

Think of it as "hibernate mode" for your brain + computer combined.

## Key Features

### 1. Quick Capture (Cmd+Shift+S)
- One hotkey to save current session
- Optional voice note: "I was debugging the auth flow, next step is checking the token expiry"
- Auto-captures: browser tabs, open files, active app windows

### 2. Session Timeline
- Visual timeline of saved sessions
- Search by project, date, or content
- Preview what was open before restoring

### 3. Smart Restoration
- Reopens tabs and files exactly as they were
- Shows your voice note/text reminder
- Optional: restore clipboard contents

### 4. Context Tags
- Auto-tag by project (based on folder/repo)
- Manual tags for organization
- Filter and group sessions

### 5. Interruption Log
- Track what interrupted you (meeting, Slack, phone)
- Patterns: "You get interrupted most at 2-3pm"
- Insights for protecting focus time

## Why This Is Different

| Feature | Tab Managers | Workspace Apps | FlowState |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Save browser tabs | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Save open files | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Save mental context | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Voice notes | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cross-app capture | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Interruption tracking | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Technical Approach

### MVP (Browser Extension + Desktop App)
- **Browser extension:** Capture/restore tabs, inject capture UI
- **Desktop companion:** Window positions, open files (using accessibility APIs)
- **Local storage:** Privacy-first, all data stays local
- **Optional sync:** Encrypted cloud backup

### Stack
- **Extension:** Chrome/Firefox/Edge (WebExtension API)
- **Desktop:** Electron or Tauri (cross-platform)
- **Storage:** Local SQLite + optional encrypted cloud
- **Voice:** Web Speech API for transcription

## Monetization

- **Free tier:** 5 active sessions, 7-day history
- **Pro ($8/mo):** Unlimited sessions, voice notes, cloud sync
- **Team ($15/user/mo):** Shared session templates, team insights

## Competition & Differentiation

| Competitor | What They Do | FlowState Advantage |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| OneTab | Saves tabs to a list | No mental context, no restoration |
| Workona | Browser workspace manager | Browser-only, no voice notes |
| Notion | Documents & wikis | Manual capture, no automation |
| Raycast | Command launcher | No session persistence |

**Key differentiator:** FlowState captures the *human* context (what you were thinking) alongside the *digital* context (what was open).

## Market Size

- 1B+ knowledge workers globally
- Context switching costs companies $450B/year in lost productivity
- TAM: $50B+ productivity software market
