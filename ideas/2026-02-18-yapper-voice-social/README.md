# Yapper - Asynchronous Voice Social Network

> "TikTok meets Twitter, but it's all voice. No text, no video — just people saying what they think."

## The Problem

Social media has become exhausting:
- **Text fatigue** — Typing out thoughts feels laborious, lacks nuance and emotion
- **Video overwhelm** — TikTok/Reels require being camera-ready, edited, performative
- **Synchronous pressure** — Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces require real-time presence
- **AI content flood** — Text is easily faked; voice carries authenticity

A user on X/Twitter perfectly captured the gap:

> "I wish there was an app that was like TikTok and twitter blended, like you say your thoughts only in voice message so it's no text or video. Just say your thoughts in voice message." — @hotsezybabe

## The Solution

**Yapper** — An asynchronous voice-first social network where:

- **Posts are voice clips** (15-90 seconds)
- **No camera required** — Just tap and talk
- **Asynchronous** — Record whenever, listen whenever
- **Reply with voice** — Full conversations in audio
- **Human-first** — Voice is harder to fake, more authentic

Think Twitter's format + podcast intimacy + voice note convenience.

## Target Users

1. **Voice note lovers** — Already send 10+ voice messages daily on WhatsApp/iMessage
2. **Camera-shy creators** — Have thoughts to share but don't want to be on video
3. **Commuters & multitaskers** — Can listen while doing other things
4. **Authenticity seekers** — Tired of AI-generated text, want real human voices
5. **ADHD / dyslexic users** — Speaking is easier than typing for many
6. **Podcast listeners** — Already consuming hours of audio daily

## Competitive Landscape
