# PromiseHold — Track What People Promised You

**One-liner:** Never let anyone forget what they said they'd do.

## The Problem

People make promises all the time:
- "I'll pay you back next week"
- "I'll send you that document by Friday"
- "We'll discuss your raise in Q3"
- "I'll fix that bug before release"
- "Let's grab coffee — I'll reach out"

The problem? **You forget to follow up, and they conveniently forget too.**

Unlike your own to-do list, tracking what *others* owe you is awkward. You can't add items to their calendar. You're left hoping they remember, then feeling awkward when they don't.

### Why This Matters
- **Money:** That $200 your friend owes you? Gone.
- **Career:** That raise discussion? Never happened.
- **Projects:** That deliverable? Missed deadline.
- **Relationships:** That "let's hang out" person? You waited, they ghosted.

## Target Users

1. **Freelancers & Contractors** — Track client commitments, payment promises, deliverable handoffs
2. **Employees** — Track manager promises (raises, promotions, resource allocation)
3. **Friends & Family** — Money loans, favors owed, plans to be made
4. **Project Managers** — Track verbal commitments from stakeholders
5. **Anyone tired of being the "reminder person"**

## The Solution: PromiseHold

A simple app to log promises others make to you, track due dates, and get smart nudges to follow up.

### Core Features

1. **Quick Promise Capture**
   - Who promised + What + When (deadline)
   - Optional: context, evidence (screenshot, email link)
   - Voice input: "John said he'd send the proposal by Friday"

2. **Smart Due Date Tracking**
   - Visual timeline of upcoming promises
   - Overdue promises highlighted
   - "Aging" indicator showing how long overdue

3. **Follow-Up Nudges**
   - Reminder before due date ("Reminder: Sarah promised to send designs tomorrow")
   - Escalating nudges for overdue items
   - Suggested follow-up messages

4. **Promise Templates**
   - Money loans (amount, repayment date)
   - Work deliverables (task, deadline, dependency)
   - Social plans (activity, proposed timeline)
   - Career discussions (topic, review period)

5. **Resolution Tracking**
   - Mark as fulfilled, partially fulfilled, or broken
   - Pattern recognition: "Alex has broken 3 promises this quarter"
   - Trust score per person (private, for your eyes only)

6. **Evidence Vault**
   - Screenshot the text/email where they promised
   - Link to Slack/email thread
   - "I said, they said" context capture

### Differentiators

- **Not a to-do app** — This tracks what OTHERS owe YOU
- **Not a CRM** — No sales pipeline, no deals, just personal accountability
- **Not aggressive** — Gentle reminders, not debt collection vibes
- **Privacy-first** — Your trust scores and notes stay local

## Market Research

### Competition
| App | What It Does | Gap |
|-----|--------------|-----|
| Splitwise | Tracks shared expenses | Only money, not general commitments |
| Todoist/Asana | Your own tasks | Not designed for tracking others' promises |
| CRM tools | Sales pipelines | Overkill for personal use |
| Reminders | Generic alerts | No promise-specific context |

### Market Size
- 70%+ of people have been ghosted on a repayment (informal surveys)
- 85% of employees feel managers forget verbal commitments
- Average person is owed $500+ in forgotten loans/favors

## Revenue Model

**Freemium:**
- **Free:** Up to 20 active promises, basic reminders
- **Pro ($4/mo):** Unlimited promises, evidence vault, trust scores, export
- **Team ($8/user/mo):** Shared workspace for tracking stakeholder commitments

## Tech Stack (Prototype)

- Pure HTML/CSS/JS for MVP
- LocalStorage for offline-first
- Future: sync via optional account

## Why Now?

1. **Remote work** = more verbal/Slack promises, harder to track
2. **AI assistants** can help capture promises from conversations
3. **Gig economy** = more informal agreements needing tracking
4. **Financial stress** = people more aware of money owed
